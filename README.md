A production-grade intern management platform for UptoSkills. Real-time, RBAC-protected, AI-grounded, and engineered for the operational needs of an internship program: onboarding, knowledge base, daily reports, attendance, projects, reviews, announcements, and analytics.

---

## Why SkillNova

- Built around a four-tier role model (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, MENTOR, INTERN) with a fine-grained permission matrix instead of a binary admin/user split.
- Every privileged action is recorded in an audit log; every state change can be reviewed.
- The AI assistant is grounded on the platform's own knowledge base and live data, not just a generic LLM.
- Performance and reliability are first-class: in-memory LRU cache backed by Redis, request coalescing, ETag-based 304s, real readiness probes.
- One monorepo, two runnable artifacts: an Express + Prisma API and a React 19 + Vite frontend, both tested in CI on every push.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 LTS (`nvm use`)
- A PostgreSQL database (Neon free tier works)
- Optional: an Upstash Redis REST URL and token
- Optional: a Groq API key for the AI assistant

> **Windows users:** Use [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) to run shell commands. All subsequent commands assume a POSIX-compatible shell.

### Bootstrap

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies for both workspaces
npm install
npm run server:install

# 2. Copy and fill the env templates
cp .env.example .env
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env with DATABASE_URL, JWT_*, CSRF_SECRET, etc.

# 3. Push the Prisma schema and seed demo data
cd server
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:push
npm run seed
cd ..

# 4. Run the API and the frontend together
npm start
```

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend (Vite) | http://localhost:5273 |
| API | http://localhost:4000 |
| Health (liveness) | http://localhost:4000/healthz/live |
| Health (readiness) | http://localhost:4000/healthz/ready |

### Demo accounts

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Super Admin | `superadmin@skillnova.com` | `SuperAdmin#2026` |
| Admin | `admin@skillnova.com` | `Admin#2026` |
| Mentor | `mentor@skillnova.com` | `Mentor#2026` |
| Intern | `rahul@skillnova.com` | `User#2026` |
| Intern | `user@skillnova.com` | `User#2026` |

In development, the OTP code is returned in the login response (`devCode`) and shown on the OTP page, so the full 2FA flow can be exercised without an SMTP server.

## Performance

| Layer | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Hot reads | Two-tier cache: in-memory LRU (L1, sub-ms) backed by Redis (L2, distributed). See `server/src/utils/cache.js` and `server/src/utils/lru.js`. |
| Auth middleware | User-by-id lookup is cached for 60 s; cache is invalidated on profile, role, or status mutation. |
| `/auth/me` | Full payload (with `internProfile` and `mentorProfile`) is cached for 30 s. |
| Analytics | `/analytics/platform` cached 60 s, `/analytics/interns` cached 30 s. |
| KB articles | List endpoint cached 30 s, keyed on the full query vector. |
| Announcements | List endpoint cached 20 s. |
| User directory | List endpoint cached 15 s. |
| HTTP responses | ETag middleware on every GET returns 304 on identical re-requests. |
| Concurrent requests | `lru.wrap` coalesces in-flight calls for the same key into a single fetcher. |
| Frontend | Every page in every shell (`admin`, `mentor`, `user`) is `React.lazy` + `Suspense`. Vendor code is split into `vendor-react`, `vendor-charts`, `vendor-dnd`, `vendor-motion`, `vendor-icons`, `vendor-md`, `vendor-date`, `vendor-socket`. |

Measured locally against the remote Postgres + Redis:

| Endpoint | Cold | Hot (cache hit) | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/auth/me` | ~3.4 s | ~5 ms | ~700x |
| `/analytics/platform` | ~4.0 s | ~3 ms | ~1300x |
| `/analytics/interns` | ~2.9 s | ~6 ms | ~500x |

---

## Real-time

Connect with the access token:

```js
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
const socket = io('http://localhost:4000', {
  auth: { token: accessToken },
  withCredentials: true,
});

socket.on('notification', (n) => { /* new in-app notification */ });
socket.on('broadcast',   (b) => { /* platform-wide or role-wide event */ });
```

Rooms: `user:<id>` (personal), `role:<role>` (broadcast by role).

---

## AI assistant

The assistant at `/api/v1/ai/chat` (non-streaming) and `/api/v1/ai/chat/stream` (SSE) is grounded on three sources, in priority order:

1. The curated **UptoSkills Knowledge Base** (`server/src/ai/uptoskills.kb.js`) — onboarding, reports, attendance, mentorship, code of conduct, FAQs, glossary.
2. **Live platform data** — recent KB articles, current announcements, and the user's own reports.
3. General model knowledge, used only when neither of the above applies.

Each reply carries a `sessionId` so conversations can be resumed. Streaming responses use Server-Sent Events so they work through any HTTP proxy without extra WebSocket plumbing.

The default model is `llama-3.1-8b-instant` for low latency. Override with `GROQ_MODEL`.

---

## Observability

| Concern | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Structured logs | Pino (JSON in prod, pretty in dev) at `server/src/utils/logger.js` |
| Request IDs | Every response carries `x-request-id`; surfaced in 5xx bodies (`server/src/middleware/requestId.js`) |
| Health checks | `/healthz/live` and `/healthz/ready` (Postgres + Redis ping) |
| Audit log | `prisma.auditLog` records every privileged action with user, IP, user-agent, and a JSON `meta` blob |
| Rate-limit telemetry | Every rate-limited response carries `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After` |

---

## Security

- Helmet sets the standard hardening headers.
- CORS uses an explicit allow-list (no wildcard).
- CSRF is a double-submit cookie pattern verified on every mutating request.
- JWTs are short-lived (15 min default) with separate access and refresh secrets.
- File downloads use HMAC-signed URLs with TTL.
- Webhook deliveries are HMAC-signed and retried with exponential backoff.
- All secrets required by `server/src/config/index.js` are enforced at boot in production; in development and test, missing values are substituted with loud warnings so unit tests can run without a populated `.env`.

---

## Testing

```bash
cd server
npm test
```

Suite: 26 tests across 5 files.

| File | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `ApiError.test.js` | Status / message propagation and static helpers |
| `auth.test.js` | Password hashing, OTP generation, token hashing, CSRF round-trip |
| `cache.test.js` | Two-tier cache layer (get, set, del, wrap, incr) |
| `lru.test.js` | In-memory LRU (TTL eviction, wrap coalescing, refresh-after-expiry) |
| `rbac.test.js` | Permission matrix for every role |

The server lints with ESLint flat config; the frontend lints with the project-wide ESLint setup.

```bash
# Backend
cd server && npm run lint && npm test

# Frontend
npm run lint && npm run build
```

---

## CI / CD

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push and pull request to `main` and `feat/**`:

| Job | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `server-lint` | `cd server && npm run lint` |
| `server-test` | `cd server && npm test` |
| `frontend-lint` | `npm run lint` |
| `frontend-build` | `npm run build` |
| `full-check` | Aggregator; fails if any upstream job failed |

Node version is pinned to whatever `.nvmrc` declares.

---

## Deployment

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This boots the API and the static frontend behind nginx. SSL, horizontal scaling, and CDN configuration are out of scope here — plug your own infrastructure in front.

The frontend container is a static build served by nginx with SPA fallback to `index.html`. The backend container runs `node src/index.js` with `NODE_ENV=production`. Both share a `.env` file at the project root for runtime configuration.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Tests fail with "Missing required env var"**

The server validates production-required env vars at boot. In CI the `fix(server): make config tolerant of missing env vars outside production` change substitutes random placeholders with a warning. If you see this in development, copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` and fill the required values.

**Login returns `step: 'otp_required'` but you never set up 2FA**

You are logging in as a user with `twoFactorEnabled: true`. In development the OTP code is in the login response as `devCode`. In production it is sent over the configured channel (email or TOTP).

**`/healthz/ready` returns 503**

One of Postgres or Redis is unreachable. The body has `checks: { db: boolean, redis: boolean }` showing which.

**AI assistant returns generic replies**

Either `GROQ_API_KEY` is missing / invalid, or the curated KB has no relevant section. Check the server logs for `groq:` entries.
